This xcode bundle provides SummaryString formatters for various Qt4 objects.

Currently contains:
    - QString
    - QVariant
    - QModelIndex
    - QFile
    - QDomNode
    - QDomElement

Building:

- Open the *.xcodeproj file in Xcode.
- Select the Release target (unless you want to debug/contribute!)
- Click Build (or CMD+B)

Place the resulting bundle ($project/build/Release/Qt4DataFormatter.bundle) in

     ~/Library/Application\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/CustomDataViews

If you wish to contribute, build a debug target. I also suggest creating a
symlink to the build/Debug/Qt4DataFormatter.bundle directory in your
~/Library/Application\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/CustomDataViews. By
doing so, your changes are immediately reflected in the debugger on each build.

Cheers,
